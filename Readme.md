# Project Recars

Recars is a web-based application that provides services for renting two famous car brands, namely BMW and Mercedes. Not only that, payments on Recars have been integrated using Midtrans. Users can browse cars and if they want to rent a car, they need to log in first. In addition to the User page, this project provides an Admin page to manage User data, car data and can also export renter report data into an excel file. And finally, this project uses an online database so make sure to have a stable internet connection.

## How to Use

- Download the Project in this repo as a zip or you can also git clone it
- When making a Midtrans payment, please don't pay for real because it's still a sandbox not production.
If the payment method uses virtual BCA, copy the contents and then pay via the Midtrans simulator
